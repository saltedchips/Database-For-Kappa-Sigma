Remade the base database by building off of migrations as to create an easier process of creating models. 

*** ADDED ***
Model: Member
    Member currently has student id, name, classes, grade/GPA, address, and service hours.
    left to do is create the rest of the models from the EER diagram as well as make connections between member and 
    other models. 


Model: Course
    This model is to act as a catalog of the classes a member is taking. It includes Professors name, Time, Credit 
    hours, and Section. This model has yet to be fully built and needs more work to be completed.


Basic web functionality
    Created a proper connection between the database and a "website" after running npm run dev the user can open the 
    browser and navigate to a home page that returns Hello World! as well as as \members page that returns an OK. What 
    the \members page is doing is actually searching and finding all the current data in the members model then 
    returns it but since its empty nothing is returned. 


*** CHANGED ***

    added 2 npm commands:
    "migrate": "npx sequelize-cli db:migrate"
    "undo": "npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo"
    
    This is to mage migrating easier as well as undoing migrations. 

    Updated passwords and added new packages
