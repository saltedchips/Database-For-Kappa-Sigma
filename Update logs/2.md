Remade the base database by building off of migrations as to create an easier process of creating models. 

*** ADDED ***
Model: Member
    Member currently has student id, name, classes, grade/GPA, address, and service hours.
    left to do is create the rest of the models from the EER diagram as well as make connections between member and other models. 

Model: Course
    This model is to act as a catalog of the classes a member is taking. It includes Professors name, Time, Credit hours, and Section. This model has yet to be fully built and needs more work to be completed.

*** CHANGED ***
    added 2 npm commands:
    "migrate": "npx sequelize-cli db:migrate",
    "undo": "npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo"
    
    This is to mage migrating easier as well as undoing migrations.
